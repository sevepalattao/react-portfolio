            <p>
                Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio Page! My name is Seve Palattao. I am originally
                from Minneapolis, Minnesota and I currently live in Chicago, Illinois. I am a
                recent college graduate from the class of 2022 at the University of Minnesota.
                Upon graduation, I enrolled in the coding and web development boot-camp through
                the U of M. I made this decision because I majored in Management Information 
                Systems, and I became interested in programming but did not want to switch my 
                major and stay in school. 

                I am an aspiring web developer interested in video games, sports, and technology.
                I love solving problems and learning new things, especially new technologies. 
                I look forward to learning new skills and seeing what opportunities the future holds!
